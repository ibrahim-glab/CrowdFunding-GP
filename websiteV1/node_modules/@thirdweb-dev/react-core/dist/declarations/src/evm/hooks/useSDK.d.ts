/**
 * Hook to get the instance of the `ThirdwebSDK` class being used by the `ThirdwebProvider` component.
 *
 * This gives access to all of the functionality of the TypeScript SDK in your React app.
 *
 * - If there is a connected wallet, the SDK is instantiated from the connected walletâ€™s signer. Meaning all transactions are initiated from the connected wallet.
 * - If there is no connected wallet, the SDK is in read-only mode on the activeChain.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { useSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
 *
 * function App() {
 *   const sdk = useSDK();
 *
 *   // Now you use all of the TypeScript SDK functionality
 *   // For example, deploy a new contract from the connected wallet.
 *   async function deployContract() {
 *     sdk?.deployer.deployNFTDrop({
 *       name: "My NFT Drop",
 *       primary_sale_recipient: "{{wallet_address}}",
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
